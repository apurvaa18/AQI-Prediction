# AQI-Prediction

Traditional air quality monitoring systems use ground-based sensors that, while accurate, have limited spatial coverage, are costly to maintain, and lack real-time or predictive capabilities. With few stations in a city, they fail to capture air quality variations across regions, hindering effective decision-making by authorities and the public.

Project Objectives:-
1. Develop a reliable air quality prediction model.
2. Identify key factors influencing air quality.
3. Provide real-time and short-term predictions.
4. Raise public awareness and enable proactive measures.
